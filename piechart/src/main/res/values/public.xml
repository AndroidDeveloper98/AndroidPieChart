<!-- All resources in a library default to public. To prevent users of your library
     from accessing resources intended only for internal use, you should use this
     automatic private designation mechanism by declaring one or more public resources.
     Alternately, you can make all resources private by adding an empty <public /> element,
     which marks nothing as public, which makes everything else (all resources) private. -->
<resources>
  <public name="my_lib_name" type="string"/>
</resources>
